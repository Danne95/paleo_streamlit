# paleo_streamlit
Paleography streamlit files
--old version--


This is a repository of my paleography classification project.
This repository was created in order to use Streamlit's cloud service,
it is possible to run the website on the service for free,
the cloud pulls the code from GitHub and runs it.


we can find:
the main(main.py) python file that has all the web application configurations and features,
myConfig folder which holds the preprocess and prediction functions as well as the trained models used for classification,
requirements.txt hold libraries and version so that the script knows what it needs to install in order to run the project.
